A foundation for libraries and applications.

When you have to integrate with many different applications, many different framework with many different technologies you need a toolkit to help.
From SalesForce to ServiceNow to React you need to write JavaScript/TypeScript and you need tools to help.

Want to share state between Lightning web components? @joist/di is here to help. Need to monitor changes to class properties? @joist/observable.
This toolkit is here to help provide just the functionality you need and nothing more. Use with Lit, FAST, Vanilla WC, Node, wherever you find yourself.
